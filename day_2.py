Let's take a look at the input command and how that works. Input is when the user gives information to the computer. It's very similar to the print command, except that it'll show the message in the console then wait until the user has typed something into the console and pressed enter. Let's try it!
input asks for something, takes it, but then has nowhere to put it. We can change that with a variable which is a value that we can use to name and store data. (Remember, David's box for David's phone?)
Naming variables like:
***You can give a variable any name you want, but you can't use spaces. You can use:
1. underscores_between_words
2. camelCaseToMakeItEasierToRead
